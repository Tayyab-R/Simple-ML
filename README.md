Machine learning is a powerful field that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. In this project, we will focus on regression, which involves predicting continuous values based on input features. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of the key concepts in regression, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you should have some basic knowledge of Python and a working understanding of machine learning concepts. If you're new to machine learning, don't worry! We have prepared a set of Jupyter notebooks that will guide you through the entire process step-by-step.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── data/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── dataset.csv

```

The data directory contains the dataset used in this project, along with a README file providing more information about the dataset. The notebooks directory contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the different stages of the machine learning process.

## Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

``` pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn ```
Installation
To use this project, you can clone the repository using the following command:


``` git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simple-ML.git ```
### Usage
Once you have the repository on your local machine, navigate to the notebooks directory, and start exploring the Jupyter notebooks in sequential order. Each notebook is designed to build upon the previous one, helping you understand the regression process step by step.
